# Rates_of_Compact_Object_Coalescence

# Introduction
This scripts (jupyter notebook) in this github directory can be used to reproduce the main figures (the three figures with the rates) from the review paper by Mandel & Broekgaarden (2021) on "Rates of Compact Object Coalescence". In order to reproduce the figures one needs to download the data that is available on https://zenodo.org/record/5072401 doi: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5072401.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5072401) !Make sure to use the latest version of the dataset!

To make the figures from the paper, put all the data (at least 26 files, unless you are only interested in reproducing one of the Compact Object flavors) in one directory and run the jupyter notebook in https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/Rates_of_Compact_Object_Coalescence/tree/main/plottingCode/Make_figures_Mandel_and_Broekgaarden_2021_COC_rates_review.ipynb
