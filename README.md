# Rates_of_Compact_Object_Coalescence

# Introduction
This scripts (jupyter notebook) in this github directory can be used to reproduce the main figures (the three figures with the rates) from the review paper by Mandel & Broekgaarden (2021) on "Rates of Compact Object Coalescence". In order to reproduce the figures one needs to download the data that is available on https://zenodo.org/record/7017532 doi:[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7017532.svg)](https://zenodo.org/record/7017532) !Make sure to use the latest version of the dataset! [and note that version 5 creates the published version, whereas version 6 of the data is ahead and corresponds with the ArXiv version]

To make the figures from the paper, put all the data (at least 26 files, unless you are only interested in reproducing one of the Compact Object flavors) in one directory and run the jupyter notebook in https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/Rates_of_Compact_Object_Coalescence/tree/main/plottingCode/Make_figures_Mandel_and_Broekgaarden_2021_COC_rates_review.ipynb 

An example of one of the figures that the main code will repruduce is given below. 


### Additional figures
Variations of the figures that are available for use / to use in presentations can be found in the following two slide decks:
(more are on the way)

                   et al. (2021) and updated the rates (we
                   accidentaly quoted the wrong rates from the wrong
                   paper)   - Added Nuclear star cluster dynamics,
                   with SMBH from Fragione et al. (2019) for BHBH,
                   NSBH, and NSNS rates  - Boekholt et al. (2022)
                   added under AGN rates  - added Stegmann (2022) to
                   triple channels   - added Olejek (2022)  - Added

                   names, and has removed the Mandhai 2018 rates
                   since these authors quote SGRB rates and not BNS
                   rates.   Version 4 has additional rates from
                   recent papers and is updated to include the GWTC-3
                   results  11/19/21. This is the version that was
                   used for the re-submitted paper.  Version 3 has
                   additional rates that we added after receiving
                   useful feedback from the community (post ArXiv
                   submission)  Version 2 has updated and additional
